## Description

This repository is the BE side of my Pet Adoption project, the final project from my <itc> full stack bootcamp. 
The porpuse of the site is to stimulate a pet adoption agency, fill free to look around, explore, adopt pets and so on, enjoy!

## Instrustions

After you clone the repo, first you have to 'npm install' in order to get all packages.
After that you have to make sure to have nodemon package installed globally on you pc.
And then run 'nodemon server' and the server will get on running, you will even be able to make changes and server will update automatically ;) 
When you are done with these, move on to the FE repo, clone it and follow instructions, have fun!
